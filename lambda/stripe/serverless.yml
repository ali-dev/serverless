# Welcome to Serverless!
#
# This file is the main config file for your service.
# It's very minimal at this point and uses default values.
# You can always add more config options for more control.
# We've included some commented out config examples here.
# Just uncomment any of them to get that config option.
#
# For full config options, check the docs:
#    docs.serverless.com
#
# Happy Coding!

# @TODO: include configurations from sls-config 

service: stripe # NOTE: update this with your service name
#app: your-app-name
#tenant: your-tenant-name

# You can pin your service to only deploy with a specific Serverless version
# Check out our docs for more details
